Yes, your understanding is correct. Here is a more detailed explanation:

- **Soft Link (Symbolic Link)**: A soft link is a pointer to another file or directory. It acts as a shortcut that points to the original file or directory. If the original file or directory is deleted, the soft link becomes a broken link and no longer works.

- **Hard Link**: A hard link is another name for an existing file. It points directly to the data on the disk. Multiple hard links to the same data are indistinguishable from each other. If the original file is deleted, the data still exists as long as there is at least one hard link pointing to it.

In summary:
- Soft Link: Pointer to the original file/directory.
- Hard Link: Another pointer directly to the data.
