 `pg_rewind` is a tool provided with PostgreSQL that is used to synchronize a PostgreSQL database cluster with another copy of the same cluster. This is particularly useful in scenarios where you have a standby server that has diverged from the primary server due to a failover or other reasons.

The basic idea behind `pg_rewind` is that it makes it possible to bring a former master server back online as a standby without requiring a full base backup. This can be a significant time saver, especially with large databases.

Here's a simplified example of how `pg_rewind` is typically used:

**Scenario**: Imagine you have a primary PostgreSQL server (`Server A`) and a standby server (`Server B`). Due to a network issue, `Server B` gets isolated and then is promoted to a primary server. Later, when the network issue is resolved, you want to reintegrate `Server B` back as a standby server to the original primary (`Server A`), which is still operational.

**Steps**:

1. **Ensure Server B is Stopped**: Before you can use `pg_rewind`, the server that needs to be synchronized (`Server B` in our case) must be cleanly shut down.

2. **Run pg_rewind**:
   - You would execute `pg_rewind` on `Server B`, using the data directory of `Server B` and connecting to the current primary server (`Server A`).

    Example command:
    ```bash
    pg_rewind --target-pgdata=/path/to/server_b/data --source-server='host=server_a_host port=5432 user=your_user dbname=your_db'
    ```

   In this command:
   - `--target-pgdata` is the data directory of the server to be synchronized (`Server B`).
   - `--source-server` specifies the connection string to the current primary server (`Server A`).

3. **Restart Server B as Standby**: After `pg_rewind` completes, you can start `Server B` as a standby server. It will now be in sync with `Server A` and can continue replication from the point where `pg_rewind` synchronized it.

**Important Notes**:

- `pg_rewind` requires that the servers have been set up with WAL archiving or streaming replication, as it relies on WAL records to synchronize the data.
- Both servers must have been running the same major version of PostgreSQL.
- It's important to ensure proper backups and to understand the current state of your clusters before using tools like `pg_rewind`, as incorrect usage can lead to data loss.

Remember, this is a simplified example. In real-world scenarios, additional considerations like network configurations, authentication, and specific PostgreSQL settings will also play a role.
