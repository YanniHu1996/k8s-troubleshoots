When you run the `CHECKPOINT` command in PostgreSQL, several internal processes are triggered to ensure data integrity and to optimize database performance. Here's a detailed breakdown of what happens:

1. **Synchronization of Data to Disk**: The primary purpose of a checkpoint is to synchronize data that is in memory (specifically in the PostgreSQL buffer cache) with the data on disk. This includes writing all dirty pages (modified pages that have not yet been written to disk) to the data files on disk.

2. **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Files Management**: PostgreSQL uses Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for transaction logging. Before any changes to data files are made, the changes are recorded in the WAL. During a checkpoint, all WAL records up to the point of the checkpoint are guaranteed to be written to the disk. This is crucial for recovery purposes in case of a crash, as it ensures that all transactions that were committed before the checkpoint can be recovered.

3. **Updating the Checkpoint Location**: The location of the current checkpoint is recorded in the `pg_control` file. This includes the WAL location up to which all changes have been written to disk. This information is vital for crash recovery, as it marks the starting point from where PostgreSQL should begin reading WAL records to recover the database state.

4. **Minimizing Recovery Time**: By performing checkpoints at regular intervals, PostgreSQL reduces the amount of time it would take to recover from a crash. Without checkpoints, PostgreSQL would have to replay the WAL from the very beginning, which could be time-consuming.

5. **Recycling WAL Files**: After a checkpoint, WAL files that are no longer needed for crash recovery can be recycled. This involves either deleting them or marking them for reuse, depending on the archive settings and whether the files have been archived for backup purposes.

6. **Managing Old Row Versions**: PostgreSQL uses Multiversion Concurrency Control (MVCC) to handle concurrent transactions. During a checkpoint, old row versions that are no longer needed can be marked for removal by the Vacuum process, which helps in reclaiming disk space and maintaining database performance.

7. **Freezing Tuple XIDs**: To prevent transaction ID (XID) wraparound, a checkpoint process can freeze the XIDs of tuples in tables, marking them as permanently valid. This is part of PostgreSQL's strategy to manage XIDs, which are limited to 4 billion in a cycle.

8. **Reducing I/O Spikes**: By regularly writing data to disk, checkpoints help to spread out disk I/O, preventing large I/O spikes which could occur if all dirty buffers were written to disk at once in case of a crash or shutdown.

9. **Update of Statistics and Status Data**: Checkpoints also involve updating various system statistics and status data, which are used for monitoring and optimizing the database performance.

In summary, a checkpoint in PostgreSQL is a crucial process that ensures data durability, aids in crash recovery, manages WAL and buffer cache effectively, and helps in maintaining overall database performance. It's a blend of data synchronization, log management, and maintenance routines working together to keep the database robust and efficient.
