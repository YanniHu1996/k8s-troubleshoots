# Understanding PostgreSQL `full_page_writes`: Safeguarding Against Partial Page Writes

In the world of PostgreSQL, ensuring data integrity is paramount, especially in scenarios involving unexpected system crashes or power failures. One critical setting that helps in maintaining this integrity is `full_page_writes`. This blog post delves into what partial page writes are, why they occur, the role of `full_page_writes` in preventing them, and provides examples to illustrate these concepts clearly.

## What are Partial Page Writes?

A partial page write happens when only a portion of a database page is successfully written to disk, with the write operation for the remainder of the page either failing or being incomplete. This scenario can lead to a situation where the page on disk is left in an inconsistent state, mixing old and new data â€” a real problem for database integrity.

### Causes of Partial Page Writes

Partial page writes are typically the result of hardware failures, power outages, or system crashes that interrupt the disk write operation. If the system crashes after part of a page has been written but before the entire operation completes, the affected page could end up corrupted, containing a blend of updated and outdated data.

## The Role of `full_page_writes`

To mitigate the risk of partial page writes and ensure data integrity, PostgreSQL offers a configuration parameter called `full_page_writes`. When enabled, it forces PostgreSQL to write the entire content of a page to the WAL (Write-Ahead Logging) file the first time that page is modified after a checkpoint, before any changes are made to the actual disk page.

### How `full_page_writes` Works

With `full_page_writes` enabled, PostgreSQL captures and stores a full copy of each modified page in the WAL at the first modification after a checkpoint. This action ensures that if a crash or power loss occurs, PostgreSQL can use the WAL to completely restore the affected pages to their correct state before applying further changes, thus avoiding partial page writes and ensuring data integrity.

## Example Scenario: Update Operation

Let's break down a simple update operation to understand the impact of `full_page_writes`.

### Without `full_page_writes` Enabled

1. **Update Operation**: A row within a page is modified.
2. **WAL Recording**: Only the changes (delta) are written to the WAL.
3. **Crash Occurs**: A power loss happens before the modified page is fully written to disk.
4. **Recovery**: PostgreSQL attempts to replay the WAL. However, since the page was not fully written, applying the delta to the partially updated page results in data corruption.

### With `full_page_writes` Enabled

1. **Update Operation**: The same row is modified.
2. **WAL Recording**: The entire page, as it appeared at the time of the modification, is written to the WAL.
3. **Crash Occurs**: Similar power loss as before.
4. **Recovery**: PostgreSQL uses the full page image from the WAL to restore the page to its correct state before applying further changes, thus maintaining data integrity.

## Visual Representation

Consider a data page as a simple grid:

```
Before Update:       After Partial Write:       Ideal Full Page Write:
[A][B][C][D]         [A'][B'][C][D]              [A'][B'][C][D]
```

- `[A]`, `[B]`, `[C]`, `[D]`: Original data.
- `[A']`, `[B']`: Data after the update.
- Partial Write: Only `[A']` and `[B']` are successfully written due to a crash; `[C]` and `[D]` remain unchanged, leading to inconsistency.
- Full Page Write: The entire page `[A'][B'][C][D]` is restored from WAL, ensuring consistency.

## Conclusion

The `full_page_writes` setting in PostgreSQL is a crucial configuration for preventing partial page writes and ensuring the database's data integrity, especially in the face of unexpected failures. While it may introduce a slight performance overhead due to increased I/O operations, the benefit of safeguarding against data corruption is invaluable. Thus, understanding and appropriately configuring `full_page_writes` is essential for any PostgreSQL database administrator aiming to maintain a reliable and robust database system.
