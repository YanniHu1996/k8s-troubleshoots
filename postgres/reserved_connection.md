Sure, let's break down the two PostgreSQL settings: `reserved_connections` and `superuser_reserved_connections`.

### `reserved_connections`
- **Purpose**: This setting specifies the number of connections that are reserved for superuser access.
- **Default Value**: The default value is typically 3.
- **Usage**: These reserved connections ensure that superusers can always connect to the database even when the maximum number of connections has been reached by regular users.

### `superuser_reserved_connections`
- **Purpose**: This setting specifies the number of connections that are reserved exclusively for superusers.
- **Default Value**: The default value is typically 3.
- **Usage**: These connections are part of the total `max_connections` but are specifically reserved for superusers to ensure they can always access the database for administrative tasks.

### How They Work Together
- **Interaction**: Both settings work together to ensure that superusers can always access the database. The `reserved_connections` setting is a subset of the total `max_connections`, and within these reserved connections, the `superuser_reserved_connections` ensures that a certain number of connections are exclusively available for superusers.
- **Example**: If `max_connections` is set to 100, and `reserved_connections` is set to 10, then 90 connections are available for regular users and 10 are reserved. Out of these 10 reserved connections, if `superuser_reserved_connections` is set to 3, then 3 connections are exclusively for superusers, and the remaining 7 can be used by either superusers or other reserved roles.

### Sample Configuration
Here is an example configuration in the `postgresql.conf` file:

```plaintext


# Maximum number of connections
max_connections = 100

# Number of connections reserved for superusers
reserved_connections = 10

# Number of connections exclusively reserved for superusers
superuser_reserved_connections = 3
```

### Explanation with Example
- **Scenario**: Suppose `max_connections` is set to 100, `reserved_connections` is set to 10, and `superuser_reserved_connections` is set to 3.
- **Connections Breakdown**:
  - Total connections: 100
  - Connections for regular users: 90 (100 - 10 reserved)
  - Reserved connections: 10
    - Exclusively for superusers: 3
    - For superusers or other reserved roles: 7

This setup ensures that even if all 90 connections for regular users are occupied, superusers can still connect using the 10 reserved connections, and out of these, 3 are guaranteed to be available exclusively for superusers.

This configuration helps maintain database accessibility for administrative tasks and ensures that superusers can always perform necessary operations even under high load conditions.
