Here's a detailed explanation:

### Breakdown of the Statement

1. **GRANT USAGE**:
   - The `GRANT` command is used to give specific privileges to users or roles.
   - [`USAGE`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22USAGE%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is a specific type of privilege that allows users to access objects within the schema. It does not allow users to create, modify, or delete objects within the schema, but it does allow them to use the objects (e.g., tables, views, functions) that already exist.

2. **ON SCHEMA bdr**:
   - This specifies that the [`USAGE`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22USAGE%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") privilege is being granted on the schema named [`bdr`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22bdr%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A22%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition").
   - A schema in PostgreSQL is a namespace that contains database objects such as tables, views, and functions. It helps in organizing and managing these objects.

3. **TO public**:
   - The [`TO`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22TO%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A26%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") clause specifies the recipient of the privilege.
   - [`public`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22public%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A29%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") is a special role in PostgreSQL that includes all users. Granting privileges to [`public`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22public%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A29%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") means that every user in the database will have the specified privilege.

This means that any user can access the objects within the [`bdr`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22bdr%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A22%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") schema, but they cannot create, modify, or delete objects within that schema.

### Example Usage

If you have a schema [`bdr`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22bdr%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A22%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") that contains tables and functions, and you want all users to be able to query the tables and call the functions, you would use this statement to grant the necessary access.

### Example Scenario

1. **Creating the Schema and Objects**:
   ```sql
   CREATE SCHEMA bdr;
   CREATE TABLE bdr.example_table (
       id serial PRIMARY KEY,
       data text
   );
   CREATE FUNCTION bdr.example_function() RETURNS text AS $$
   BEGIN
       RETURN 'Hello, world!';
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
   ```

2. **Granting USAGE Privilege**:
   ```sql
   GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA bdr TO public;
   ```

3. **Accessing the Objects**:
   - Any user can now run queries like:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM bdr.example_table;
     SELECT bdr.example_function();
     ```

In summary, the [`GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA bdr TO public;`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22GRANT%20USAGE%20ON%20SCHEMA%20bdr%20TO%20public%3B%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A29%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") statement is used to allow all users to access the objects within the [`bdr`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22bdr%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22external%22%3A%22file%3A%2F%2F%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FUsers%2Fhuyantian%2Fgo%2Fsrc%2Fgithub.com%2FEnterpriseDB%2Fbdr%2Fbdr--5.6.0.sql%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A6%2C%22character%22%3A22%7D%7D%5D%5D "Go to definition") schema without giving them the ability to modify the schema or its objects.
