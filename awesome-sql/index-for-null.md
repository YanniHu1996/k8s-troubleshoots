```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY xyz_x1_null ON xyz((x1 IS NULL)) WHERE (x1 IS NULL);
```

This SQL statement is creating a specialized type of index in PostgreSQL. Let's break it down for better understanding:

1. **`CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`:** This is the command used to create a new index. The `CONCURRENTLY` keyword is crucial here. It allows the index to be built without locking out writes to the table. This means that the table `xyz` can continue to be used normally for read and write operations while the index is being created. This is particularly useful for large tables or in a production environment where you can't afford downtime.

2. **`xyz_x1_null`:** This is the name of the new index. Naming indexes is a good practice for easier management, particularly when you have multiple indexes on a table.

3. **`ON xyz`:** This specifies the table on which the index is being created, in this case, `xyz`.

4. **`((x1 IS NULL))`:** This part defines the expression that the index is based on. Instead of indexing a column directly, this index is based on the result of the expression `x1 IS NULL`. It means the index will store data about whether or not the `x1` column in each row is null.

5. **`WHERE (x1 IS NULL)`:** This is a partial index. The `WHERE` clause specifies that only rows where `x1 IS NULL` will be included in this index. This can be highly efficient in cases where queries frequently filter on `x1` being null, and only a small subset of the table's rows meet this criterion.

In summary, this statement is creating a concurrent index named `xyz_x1_null` on the `xyz` table. The index is specifically optimized for queries that check whether `x1` is null, but it only includes rows where `x1` is indeed null. This can improve the performance of such queries significantly, especially if a large portion of the table's rows have `x1` as non-null. This approach is a good example of how PostgreSQL allows for the creation of highly specialized and efficient indexes.
