To achieve what you're describing in PostgreSQL – creating a table and then inserting data into it using two different tablespaces – you need to follow a series of steps. However, it's important to clarify that in PostgreSQL, a table itself resides in a single tablespace. You can't split a single table across multiple tablespaces directly. Each tablespace represents a physical location on the disk where PostgreSQL stores database objects.

If your intention is to distribute data across multiple tablespaces for performance or management reasons, you might need to use partitioning, where each partition of a table can reside in a different tablespace. Here's a general guide on how to approach this:

1. **Create Tablespaces**: First, you need to create two tablespaces, assuming you have the necessary file system permissions and directories in place.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLESPACE tablespace1 LOCATION '/path/to/directory1';
    CREATE TABLESPACE tablespace2 LOCATION '/path/to/directory2';
    ```

2. **Create a Partitioned Table**: You create a partitioned table that will have partitions residing in different tablespaces.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE your_table ( 
        id serial PRIMARY KEY, 
        data text, 
        partition_key int -- this is used for partitioning
    ) PARTITION BY RANGE (partition_key);
    ```

3. **Create Partitions in Different Tablespaces**: Next, create partitions of this table in the different tablespaces.

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE your_table_part1 PARTITION OF your_table
        FOR VALUES FROM (0) TO (1000)
        TABLESPACE tablespace1;

    CREATE TABLE your_table_part2 PARTITION OF your_table
        FOR VALUES FROM (1000) TO (2000)
        TABLESPACE tablespace2;
    ```

4. **Insert Data**: When you insert data, PostgreSQL will automatically route it to the appropriate partition based on the partition key.

    ```sql
    INSERT INTO your_table (data, partition_key) VALUES ('Data 1', 500); -- Goes to part1
    INSERT INTO your_table (data, partition_key) VALUES ('Data 2', 1500); -- Goes to part2
    ```

In this setup, data insertion is controlled by the `partition_key` value, which determines which partition (and consequently, which tablespace) the data will be stored in. Remember that the paths specified in `CREATE TABLESPACE` must exist and be writable by the PostgreSQL server process. Also, managing tablespaces and partitioning requires proper planning and understanding of your data access patterns for efficiency and performance optimization.
